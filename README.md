# Address Book - JavaScript

This project is an **Address Book** application built using **JavaScript (Node.js)**. It provides various functionalities to manage contacts efficiently.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Ability to Create an Address Book Contact**
- Each contact includes **First Name, Last Name, Address, City, State, Zip, Phone Number, and Email**.

### 2. **Validation for Contact Fields**
- First and Last Name must **start with a capital letter and have at least 3 characters**.
- Address, City, and State must **have at least 4 characters**.
- Zip must be **exactly 6 digits**.
- Phone Number must be **exactly 10 digits**.
- Email must be **in a valid format**.
- Throws an **error if any validation fails**.

### 3. **Ability to Create an Address Book Array & Add New Contacts**
- Contacts are stored in an array.
- New contacts can be added while ensuring they pass validation.

### 4. **Ability to Find an Existing Contact by Name & Edit It**
- Searches for a contact using the first and last name.
- Allows modification of existing contact details.

### 5. **Ability to Find a Person & Delete It from the Address Book**
- Searches for a contact by name.
- Removes the contact from the array if found.

### 6. **Ability to Count the Number of Contacts in the Address Book**
- Uses **array length property** to count the total contacts.

### 7. **Ability to Ensure No Duplicate Entries of the Same Person**
- Before adding a contact, it checks if the same person (same first & last name) exists.
- Uses **Array functions like `filter()`** to perform the duplicate check.
